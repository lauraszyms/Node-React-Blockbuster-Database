# Welcome to Deep 6 Blockbuster!

In this coding challenge, we will be asking you to bring Blockbuster back from the dead. You will be required to set up a server, seed dummy data, create a RESTful API to read fromt / write to the movie inventory, and render basic UI views.

## Tech Stack
* Node /Express
* React

## Task:
(The basic file structure has been provided)
### Back-end:
1. Set up a node server and serve up a static file pointing to your application.
2. Seed dummy data (see below for the movie schema);
3. Write routes and controllers for your server to interact with your database. At minimum we would like to see pages where a user can:
    * Post a movie to the database
    * Get all movies to the database
### Front-end:
4. Set up the following routes:
    * Add movie page
    * View all movies
5. Render front end components to utilize your routes.

## Extra
If you feel like you want to add more, here are some extra ideas...
* Style!
* Include the ability to modify movie information or delete movies from the inventory
* Add authentication
* write tests!

## Data Schema:
Movie Schema:
* Title - String
* Rating (number out of 10) - String
* Year of Release - Number
